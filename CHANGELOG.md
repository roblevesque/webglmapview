#Change Log

**V0.6.1** *(1-16-2018)*
  * Moved CHANGELOG over to read CHANGELOG.md from project and parse the markdown in Javascript. Is it overkill? Sure. Do I care? No
  * Some design tweaks to improve space usage throughout sidebar, and other things

**V0.6** *(1-9-2018)*
* Simple websocket client.     (Thanks to grapenut@M\*U\*S\*H )
    * Best on tablet or desktop I would guess. Mobile might be iffy

**V0.5** *(6/14/2017)*
* Addition of changelog
* Improve responsiveness of design. Could be better.

**V0.2-0.4**
 * Additional features that I cannot recall

**V0.1**
* Initial Release
