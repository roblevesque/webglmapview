## Introduction
This is an attempt to throw together a webGL version of the Windows based Mapview program so that folks that have a Mac or other Non-Windows machine can still have a map of the game.

This is project is by no means official or complete. It is simply ment as a POC at this point. If there is enough interest in this game-side I may continue to develop it to be a fairly complete alternative to the MapView software.
