## Introduction
This is an attempt to throw together a webGL version of the Windows based Mapview program so that folks that have a Mac or other Non-Windows machine can still have a map of the game. 

This is project is by no means official or complete. It is simply ment as a POC at this point. If there is enough interest in this game-side I may continue to develop it to be a fairly complete alternative to the MapView software. 




## Contributing & Comments

Feel free. I am not a JS developer by any stretch so any desire to contribute or any desire to blast me and call me an idiot for doing X, Y or Z, go for it. Contributions can be made at any time.  Some projects I'd like to work on are:

* Interface/UX Improvements
* Additional navigation features
* Improvement of rote selection, and ability to choose the other routes 
* Live game data / Sensor Data (Based on in game token, or something of that sort) 
* Embeded client (Maybe??)
